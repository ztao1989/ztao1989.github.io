<p>
I work as a part-time teaching faculty (independent instructor) of the Data Visualization course for the ECE Department at Northeastern University, where I taught over 40 undergraduate and graduate students throughout the whole semester in Fall 2018, Spring 2019 and Fall 2019, respectively. Many thanks to the great support from my teaching assistant, guest lecturers, and all the students in my class.
